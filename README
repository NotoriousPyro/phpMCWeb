Requirements:
* Webserver with PHP 5.2.0 or better (only apache has been tested and thus recommended).
* Certain webhosts may disallow some functions that are required by phpMCWeb, those webhosts are not supported
	and will not be supported.
	It is recommended that you host phpMCWeb on the same webserver that hosts the Minecraft server. Because
	CPU usage, etc come from the localhost.
* ApiCraft Bukkit plugin

Installation:

	the "Admin" user (you can change the password later).
3: Open the file config.php and edit the two lines that read $apicraft_ip and $apicraft_port.
4: Edit the line $dynmap to read to the url of dynmap OR if you don't want dynmap, then go into the pages folder
