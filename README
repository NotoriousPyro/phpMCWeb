Requirements:
* Webserver with PHP 5.2.0 or better (only apache has been tested and thus recommended).
* Certain webhosts may disallow some functions that are required by phpMCWeb, those webhosts are not supported
	and will not be supported.
	It is recommended that you host phpMCWeb on the same webserver that hosts the Minecraft server. Because
	CPU usage, etc come from the localhost.
* ApiCraft Bukkit plugin

Optional:

Installation:
1: Copy the contents of the "web" directory to a public directory on your webserver.
2: Open the file cutenews/data/users.db.php in a text editor and change the name of
	the "Admin" user (you can change the password later).
3: Open the file config.php and edit the two lines that read $apicraft_ip and $apicraft_port.
4: Edit the line $dynmap to read to the url of dynmap OR if you don't want dynmap, then go into the pages folder
	and delete the file map.phtml.
