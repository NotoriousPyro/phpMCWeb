Requirements:
* Webserver with PHP 5.2.0 or better (only apache has been tested and thus recommended).
* Certain webhosts may disallow some functions that are required by phpMCWeb, those webhosts are not supported
	and will not be supported.
	It is recommended that you host phpMCWeb on the same webserver that hosts the Minecraft server. Because
	CPU usage, etc come from the localhost.
* ApiCraft Bukkit plugin
