Installation:
phpMCWeb 0.8.0 is not compatible with previous versions of phpMCWeb, please DELETE
your previous installation first and then follow this installation guide.
1: Copy the contents of the "web" directory to a public directory on your webserver.
2: On *nix systems, ensure that the cache folder, news folder and subdirectories
	of those folders are chmodded to 0777 (or parts of phpMCWeb will NOT work).
3: Open the file config.php and edit the lines accordingly to fit your server.
4: For $jsonapi_salt, use saltgenerator.php included. The generated salt must be exactly
	the same for both JSONAPI and phpMCWeb.
5: Browse to where you installed phpMCWeb and add /news onto the end of the URL.
6: Login to the news system and change your password. Defaults are:
	Username: admin
	Password: admin
